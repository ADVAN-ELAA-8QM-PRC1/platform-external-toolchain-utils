This is a set of scripts to use when triaging compiler problem by using
the bisecting functionality included in the sysroot_wrapper.hardened.
The only script that you need to create for your triaging problem is the
test_script.sh (The ones in this directory are here only as an example).

To run the binary searcher tool with these scripts, execute it like this:

./binary_search_state.py --get_initial_items=./sysroot_wrapper/get_initial_items.sh --switch_to_good=./sysroot_wrapper/switch_to_good.sh --switch_to_bad=./sysroot_wrapper/switch_to_bad.sh --test_script=./sysroot_wrapper/test_script.sh --noincremental --file_args 2>&1 | tee /tmp/binary_search.log
