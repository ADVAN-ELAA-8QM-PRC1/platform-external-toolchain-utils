This directory contains the bikjmp example.

It also contains the json configuration file which includes the meta data
information to run the experiment.

This directory contains a build file build_bikjmp which is used by the build
module of the framework to compile the application.
This directory contains a test file test_bikjmp which is used by the test
module of the framework to benchmark the optimization compilation.
This directory contains a conf file which includes the set of optimization flags
the experiment will try.
This directory contains an input file ren.txt which is the input to the
application.
This directory contains an application file bikjmp_bench.cpp which is the
application file.

To use this direction, first gives the file the executable permission.
  chmod a+x build_bikjmp
  chmod a+x test_bikjmp

To run, invoke the example_algorithm.py in the parent directory.
  python example_algorithms.py --file=bikjmp/example.json
