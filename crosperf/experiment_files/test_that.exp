# This is an example experiment file for Crosperf, showing how to run
# a basic test, using test_that and autotest.  You can explicitly invoke
# test_that (or not) for a particular benchmark, using the use_test_that
# field, as shown below.  Alternatively, you can pass --use_test_that=True
# or --use_test_that=False to the command line args you pass to crosperf.
